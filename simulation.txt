  "SHORT_SUMMARY": "ClassicalHost-2 sent 'hi prateek nice to meet you' to ClassicalHost-1 through a quantum-classical network involving 2 classical hops and 1 quantum hop, using quantum key distribution for secure transmission.",
  "DETAILED_SUMMARY": "The simulation started with ClassicalHost-2 sending a message to ClassicalHost-1 ([LOG_0011]). The message was routed through ClassicalRouter-3 ([LOG_0114]) and then to QC_Router_QuantumAdapter-8 ([LOG_0105]). QuantumAdapter-8 initiated QKD with QuantumAdapter-4 ([LOG_0018]) and encrypted the message ([LOG_0090]). The encrypted message was decrypted by QuantumAdapter-4 ([LOG_0108]), routed through ClassicalRouter-3 ([LOG_0114]), and delivered to ClassicalHost-1 ([LOG_0118]).",
